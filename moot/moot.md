# LambdaConf has a pretty good process

- Let's make it better!

- CFP through editing, review, and scheduling

- Tested process, serious formalization of a fair blinded process

- The organizers have to juggle of a lot of variables


# The LambdaConf organizers are wonderful, hard-working people

- but they're still human

- I'd like to incrementally automate their workflow and make their lives easier


# Not just about LambdaConf

- Lots of conferences have CFP and review processes they've invested in heavily

- It's very manual, with some conference organizers writing homebrew scripts and using a menagerie of applications and services that don't interoperate.

- Let's make this software available to others and help them automate what they're doing


# Moot will be open source

- License not yet decided, but the software will be open source and publicly available

- Backend in Haskell


# I need help, but I can offer help too

- Need help from backend devs, frontend devs, designer

- UX is important too!

- Finished Haskell Book recently, looking to dive into an application?

- I will tutor people that need help. Not just in the same capacity either!
